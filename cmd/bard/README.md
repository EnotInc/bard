# bard

The entry point of the program

To build it, run `go build`, or `go install` to add **Bard** to the `$PATH`.

Now you can provide a file name to open or create a new file. But be careful: if you just run **Bard** with no args, there is no way to save your stuff.
**Bard** can't create a file from inside Bard.
